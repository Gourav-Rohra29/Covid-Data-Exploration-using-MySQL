# Covid-Data-Exploration-using-MySQL

  In this project I have downloaded the Covid-19 data from WHO Website and done some operations. 
  Link to Dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
  
  Here is the List of some Basic operations performed.
  --> Total Deaths because of Covid.
  --> Total Covid-Cases as per Population.
  --> Highest Infection Count.
  --> Total Percentage of Population Effected.
  --> Population wise Highest deaths.
  --> Continent wise Highest deaths.
  -->	Location wise Highest deaths.
  -->	Datewise Deaths.
  -->	Worldwide Total Deaths.


I have also exported this data to Tableau to make it more insightful and understandable.

I did some Basic research out of this data. A lot more out of it can be done. :)
